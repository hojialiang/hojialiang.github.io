00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In truth from the start,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.720
I knew everything, and once all of it was over,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.620
I finally understood

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.100
The key to unravel the mystery is even now in that hand.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:30.780
About you, about me, those are about myself.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.660
Your things, my things, those things are my own.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180
One more thing, yet another thing

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.100
So, make something one thing,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.080
the thing that you can't give up on.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.640
One more thing, yet another thing

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.780
Beyond so many 'what if's'

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.220
is a future that maybe might have existed

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.180
As I gather them up, I'll chase after you

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:03.860
Hey, about you, about me.
Those are about myself

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.520
Your things, my things, those things are my own

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.900
Unknown by everyone else,

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.200
known only by you.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.740
Our story

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.880
about the you that you don't know.
