00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:10.600
Lit by the light of the moon in the blue, blue sky

2
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:20.890
Captivated by it, so sweet, so pale, so heavy

3
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.780
Under this moonlight, unknown to anyone,

4
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.450
I called out your name alone

5
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:37.360
forever searching for a future

6
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.990
within this light

7
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.640
On a night like this when nothing is in reach,

8
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.910
not a moment goes by that I'm not thinking of you

9
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.830
There isn't a day I don't think about it

10
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:05.650
Let my lost heart find you

11
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:16.160
Under this moonlight, call out my name

12
00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.250
You can be sure I'll go as far as it takes to see you,

13
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.070
within this light
